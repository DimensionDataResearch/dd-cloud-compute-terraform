# Migrating from v1.1 to v1.2

Note - these instructions also apply to migration from v1.0.

## Introduction

v1.2 of the `ddcloud` provider for Terraform introduces a couple of breaking changes. For the most part, actions for dealing with these changes can be broken into 2 main categories:

1. Migrating configuration (the resources specified in your `.tf` files)
2. Migrating state (the information stored in `terraform.tfstate`)

### Migrating configuration

For the most part, this tends to be relatively easy to handle; either properties have been renamed / had their data-type changed, or they have been moved to a different resource type.

### Migrating state

This is slightly trickier, because the Terraform state format is optimised for being machine-readable, rather than human-readable. The provider will automatically migrate state data when properties have been renamed or had their state changed, but it cannot handle properties being moved from one resource to another. For this, some manual editing is required. Where possible, the documentation will walk through how to do this, step-by-step.

## Changed resource types

* `ddcloud_server`
  * `os_image_id`, `os_image_name`, `customer_image_id`, and `customer_image_name` condensed into `image` and `image_type`
  * `primary_adapter_xxx` is now computed from `primary_adapter`.
  * Additional adapters now specified **either** via `ddcloud_server.additional_network_adapter` or `ddcloud_network_adapter`.
* `ddcloud_server_nic`
  * Renamed to `ddcloud_network_adapter`
  * Properties renamed (prefixes removed)

### ddcloud\_server

#### Configuration

Previously:

```hcl
resource "ddcloud_server" "my_server" {
  os_image_name = "Ubuntu 14.04 2 CPU"

  primary_adapter_vlan = "${ddcloud_vlan.my_vlan.id}"
  primary_adapter_ipv4 = "10.1.1.1"
}
```

Now:

```hcl
resource "ddcloud_server" "my_server" {
  # Will auto-detect that this is an image name (rather than Id)
  # Will try for OS image, and fall back to customer image if not found
  # Use os_image_type to force specific image type.
  image = "Ubuntu 14.04 2 CPU"

  primary_adapter {
      vlan = "${ddcloud_vlan.my_vlan.id}"
      ipv4 = "10.1.1.1"
  }
}
```

## ddcloud\_server\_nic

#### Configuration

Previously:

```hcl
resource "ddcloud_server_nic" "my_server_nic2" {
  server       = "${ddcloud_server.test_server.id}"
  
  vlan         = "${ddcloud_vlan.my_vlan.id}"
  private_ipv4 = "10.1.1.2"
  adapter_type = "VMXNET3"
}
```

Now:

```hcl
resource "ddcloud_network_adapter" "my_server_nic2" {
  server = "${ddcloud_server.test_server.id}"
  
  vlan   = "${ddcloud_vlan.my_vlan.id}"
  ipv4   = "10.1.1.2"
  type   = "VMXNET3"
}
```

#### State

Note that non-modified attributes are ommitted below for clarity.

Previously:

```json
{
  "modules": [
    {
      "resources": {
        "ddcloud_server_nic.my_nic": {
          "type": "ddcloud_server_nic",
          "primary": {
            "attributes": {
              "private_ipv4": "10.1.1.2",
              "adapter_type": "VMXNET3"
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

Now:

```json
{
  "modules": [
    {
      "resources": {
        "ddcloud_network_adapter.my_nic": {
          "type": "ddcloud_network_adapter",
          "primary": {
            "attributes": {
              "ipv4": "10.1.1.2",
              "type": "VMXNET3"
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}
```
